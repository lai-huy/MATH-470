\problem Alice publishes her RSA public key: modulus $N=2038667$ and exponent $e=103$.\\
\subproblem Bob wants to send Alice the message $m=892383$. What ciphertext does Bob send to Alice?

\solution
Bob sends $c=m^e\equiv45293\mod{N}$

\subproblem Alice knows that her modulus factors into a product of two primes, one of which is $p=1301$. Find a decryption exponent $d$ for Alice.

\solution
The modulus $N=1301\cdot1567$, so $\phi(N)=1300\cdot1568=2035800$.\\
A decryption exponent is given by a solution to
\[e\cdot d\equiv 1\mod{\phi(N)}\]
The solution is $d=810367\mod{\phi(N)}$

\subproblem Alice receives the ciphertext $c=317730$ from Bob. Decrypt the message.

\solution
Alice needs to solve $m^e\equiv c\mod{N}$.\\
Raising both sides to the power of $d$ yields
\[m\equiv c^{d}\mod{N}\equiv 514407\mod{N}\]

\newpage
\problem Let $N=pq=352717$ and $(p-1)(q-1)=351520$, use the method described in Remark 3.11 to determine $p$ and $q$.

\solution
$p+q=N+1-(p-1)(q-1)=1198$, so
\[X^2-(p+q)X+N=X^2-1198X+352717=(X-677)(X-521)\]
Hence $p=677,q=521$

\problem Alice decides to use RSA with the public key $N=1889570071$. In order to guard against transmission errors, Alice has Bob encrypt his message twice, once using the encryption exponent $e_1= 1021763679$ and once using the encryption exponent $e_2=519424709$. Eve intercepts the two encrypted messages
\[c_1=1244183534 \text{ and } c_2=732959706\]
Assuming that Eve also knows $N$ and the two encryption exponents $e_1$ and $e_2$, use the method described in Example 3.15 to help Eve recover Bob’s plaintext without finding a factorization of $N$.

\solution
With the method described in Example 3.15, we find that
\[u\cdot e_1+v\cdot e_2=1\]
with
\[u= 252426389 \text{ and } v=-496549570\]
Then the plaintext is
\[m\equiv c_1^{u}\cdot c_2^{v}\equiv 1054592380\mod{N}\]

\newpage
\problem Use the Miller–Rabin test on each of the following numbers. In each case, either provide a Miller-Rabin witness for the compositeness of $n$, or conclude that $n$ is probably prime by providing 10 numbers that are not Miller-Rabin witnesses for $n$.

\subproblem $n=118901509$

\solution
$n-1=118901508=2^2\cdot29725377$
\begin{flalign*}
    2^{29725377}        & \equiv 7906806 \mod{n} & \\
    2^{2\cdot29725377}  & \equiv -1      \mod{n} & \\
    3^{29725377}        & \equiv -1      \mod{n} & \\
    3^{2\cdot29725377}  & \equiv 1       \mod{n} & \\
    5^{29725377}        & \equiv -1      \mod{n} & \\
    5^{2\cdot29725377}  & \equiv 1       \mod{n} & \\
    7^{29725377}        & \equiv 7906806 \mod{n} & \\
    7^{2\cdot29725377}  & \equiv -1      \mod{n} & \\
    11^{29725377}       & \equiv -1      \mod{n} & \\
    11^{2\cdot29725377} & \equiv 1       \mod{n} & \\
\end{flalign*}
Thus $2,3,5,7$, and $11$ are not Miller–Rabin witnesses for $n$. $n$ is probably prime.

\subproblem $n=118901521$

\solution
$n-1=118901520=2^4\cdot7431345$
\begin{flalign*}
    2^{7431345}       & \equiv45274074\mod{n} & \\
    2^{2\cdot7431345} & \equiv1758249\mod{n}  & \\
    2^{4\cdot7431345} & \equiv1\mod{n}        & \\
    2^{8\cdot7431345} & \equiv1\mod{n}        & \\
\end{flalign*}
Thus 118901521 is composite. It factors into $n=271\cdot541\cdot811$

\newpage
\problem Show that the Elgamal encryption protocol is insecure against a Chosen Ciphertext Attack. More specifically, suppose Bob has published a prime $p$, primitive root $g\mod{p}$, and his public key $B$. Alice has sent Bob a ciphertext $(c_1,c_2)$. So far Eve only knows $p,g,B$, and $(c_1,c_2)$. But suppose now that Eve can somehow make Bob decrypt “random-looking” ciphertexts $(c_1', c_2')$ of Eve’s choice (by “random-looking” we mean that Bob should not be able to tell that $(c_1', c_2')$ or its decryption is related to Alice’s message in any way). Show how Eve can use this ability to decrypt Alice’s message.

\solution
We can generate a ``random" cipher text for Bob to decrypt using a second message $m'$ and Eve's secret key $k'$ as follows and a random integer $r$:
\begin{flalign*}
    c_1' & = c_1\cdot g^{k'}\mod{p}        & \\
    c_2' & = c_2\cdot r\cdot B^{k'}\mod{p} & \\
\end{flalign*}
Bob uses this information to calculate the ``encrypted" message to return the decryption:
\begin{flalign*}
    m' & \equiv (c_1')^{-b}(c_2')                  & \\
       & \equiv (c_1g^{k'})^{-b}(c_2rB^{k'})       & \\
       & \equiv (g^{k'}(g^a))^{-b}(rB^{k'}(B^am)   & \\
       & \equiv (g^{-k'b}g^{-ab})(rg^{bk'}g^{ba}m) & \\
       & \equiv rm \mod{p}
\end{flalign*}
Note that the decryption $m'$ looks random from the random integer $r$.\\
Eve can recover $m$ by multiplying Bob's decryption by $r^{-1}\mod{p}$

\newpage
\problem Let $N=pq$ be a product of two distinct odd primes $p$ and $q$. Show that there are four square roots of $1$ modulo $N$. In other words, show that there are exactly four integers in $\{1,2,3,\cdots,N-1\}$ whose squares are congruent to $1\mod{N}$.

\solution
Let $x$ be an integer such that $x^2\equiv 1\mod{N}$.\\
Since $N=pq$, we have $x^2\equiv 1\mod{p}$ and $x^2\equiv 1\mod{q}$.\\
By 1.36(a), $p,q$ are odd primes, there are exactly two solutions to $x^2\equiv 1\mod{p}$, namely $x\equiv\pm1\mod{p}$.\\
Additionally, there are exactly two solutions to $x^2\equiv 1\mod{q}$, namely $x\equiv\pm1\mod{q}$.

\noindent
So there are four possible cases for $x$:
\begin{flalign}
    x\equiv1\mod{p}\quad  & \text{ and } \quad x\equiv1\mod{q}  & \\
    x\equiv1\mod{p}\quad  & \text{ and } \quad x\equiv-1\mod{q} & \\
    x\equiv-1\mod{p}\quad & \text{ and } \quad x\equiv1\mod{q}  & \\
    x\equiv-1\mod{p}\quad & \text{ and } \quad x\equiv-1\mod{q} &
\end{flalign}
Since $p,q$ are distinct odd primes, we have $\gcd(p,q)=1$, so we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\\
Each of the four systems of congruences above have a solution that is unique modulo $N=pq$.\\
This implies that there are at most four solutions.

\noindent
To see why there are exactly four, note that $+1\not\equiv-1\mod{p}$ nor $+1\not\equiv-1\mod{q}$ (because $p,q$ are odd), so the solutions to the four systems of congruences above are distinct modulo either $p$ or $q$.\\
In either case, they are all distinct modulo $N$.\\
Hence there are exactly four solutions to $x^2\equiv 1\mod{N}$.

\newpage
\problem Suppose that you are given an integer $N$ and a pair of integers $e,d$ with the promise that $N$ is the product of two large primes and that $ed\equiv1\mod{\phi(N)}$ (but you are not given the factors of $N$ nor the value of $\phi(N)$. Describe an algorithm that efficiently factors $N$.

\solution Note that since $ed\equiv 1\mod{\phi(N)}$, by proposition, $\phi(N)\mid ed-1$. This implies that $k\cdot\phi{N}+1=ed,k\in\mathbb{Z}$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute a random integer a such that $1<a<N$. This is similar to how the Miller-Rabin primality test selects random witnesses.
    \item Calculate the value $x\equiv a^d\mod{N}$. Since $ed\equiv1\mod{\phi{(N)}}$, this means that $x^e\equiv a^{(d\cdot e)}\equiv a^{(k\cdot\phi(N)+1)}\equiv a\mod{N}$, where $k$ is an integer.

    \item Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find $g=\gcd(N,x-a)$. If the $g>1$, then it means that $N$ has a non-trivial factor in common with $x-a$.

    \item If $g=1$, repeat steps 1-3 with a different random value of $a$. Keep doing this until you find $g>1$ or until you've tried a sufficient number of random values of $a$.

    \item Once you find a $g>1$, you have effectively found one of the prime factors of $N$, either $p$ or $q$.
\end{enumerate}
